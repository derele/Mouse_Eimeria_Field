Eimeria qPCR,MC.Eimeria,This was established in 2018 as an improvement over the '> -5 delta ct rule' for identification of Eimeria -positive qPCRs. Melting curves have to show a drastic drop at XX°C to indicate melting of a proper Eimeria COI amplification product. It might be added where possible for per 2018 data post-hoc if melting curves exist for a review of raw data).,logical,,T/F,,
