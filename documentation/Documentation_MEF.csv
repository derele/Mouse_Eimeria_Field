Eimeria qPCR,delta_ct_ilwe_MminusE,Threshold cycle for mouse minus Eimeria in Ileum tissue. Only E. vermiformis is (at low pervalence in Ileum tissue) and we therfore don't obtain this data-type for all years.,num,,0-40
Eimeria qPCR,delta_ct_cewe_MminusE,threshold cycle for mouse minus Eimeria in Caecume tissue. E. ferrisi and E. falcifromis are detected here. We should have this (as coprehensively as possible) for every year,num,,0-40
Eimeria qPCR,MC.Eimeria,This was established in 2018 as an improvement over the '> -5 delta ct rule' for identification of Eimeria -positive qPCRs. Melting curves have to show a drastic drop at XXÂ°C to indicate melting of a proper Eimeria COI amplification product. It might be added where possible for per 2018 data post-hoc if melting curves exist for a review of raw data).,logical,,T/F
