## Eimeria detection qPCR

We perform relative qPCR for detection and quantification of Eimeria
DNA in intestinal tissue. We amplify a locus in the nuclear genome of
the house mouse and a locus in the mitochondrial genome (COI) of
Eimeria. We then calculate a "delta" between the two ct values.


We report these in HZ\\d\\d_qPCR.csv, standard columns are: 

- delta_ct_ilwe_MminusE: threshold cycle for mouse minus Eimeria in
  Ileum tissue. Only E. vermiformis is (at low pervalence in Ileum
  tissue) and we therfore don't obtain this data-type for all years.  

- delta_ct_cewe_MminusE: threshold cycle for mouse minus Eimeria in
  Caecume tissue. E. ferrisi and E. falcifromis are detected here. We
  should have this (as coprehensively as possible) for every year!

- MC.Eimeria: TRUE/FALSE. This was established in 2018 as an
  improvement over the '> -5 delta ct rule' for identification of
  Eimeria -positive qPCRs. Melting curves have to show a drastic drop
  at XXÂ°C to indicate melting of a proper Eimeria COI amplification
  product. It might be added where possible for per 2018 data post-hoc
  (if melting curves exist for a review of raw data).
